	     <div class="boxed-text">
		     	<p>Plot Point was thought up and created by a 14 year old high school student with one goal. 
			Both writing and coding are passions of hers and she wanted to provide others a way to learn writing 
			and help develop creativity all while having fun trying to keep a streak. This was designed specifically
			with English teachers in mind. It is very simple to use and it's an excellent way to start off English class.
			A warm up, if you will. Of course, that doesn't mean that only teachers can use Plot Point. Anyone and
			everyone is welcome to write! </p> </div>
